# Machine Learning With Python - Weather Analysis

 In this project, I used machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change
 while working as a data analyst at a European nonprofit organization (DISCLAIMER: This is part of a course in a learning bootcamp not a actual work based analysis)
 
# Key Questions

 ●  How is machine learning used? Is it applicable to weather data?
 
 ● ClimateWins has heard of ethical concerns surrounding machine learning and AI. Are
 there any concerns specific to this project?
 
 ● Historically, what have the maximums and minimums in temperature been?
 
 ● Can machine learning be used to predict whether weather conditions will be favorable on
 a certain day? (If so, it could also be possible to predict danger.)

# Data

 Data set used is based on weather observations from 18 different weather stations
 across Europe, which contain data ranging from the late 1800s to 2022. Recordings exist for
almost every day with values such as temperature, wind speed, snow, global radiation, and
 more. This data is collected by the European Climate Assessment & Data Set project.

# Systems Used

Anaconda/Jupyter Notebook: For Machine learning and Model Optimization, aswell as analysis tool
